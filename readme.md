# Interview Preparation and Training

This repository contains my solutions to various coding challenges from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

The solutions are organized by topic. The solutions are written in C++.

The solutions are not necessarily the most optimal ones. They are just the ones I came up with.

The choice of the problems is based on the roadmap created by [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/)
